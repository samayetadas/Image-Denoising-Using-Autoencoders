# Image-Denoising-Using-Autoencoders
Autoencoders are a type of Artificial Neural Networks that are used to perform a task of data encoding.It consists of 2 neural networks-The encoder part and the decoder part.Autoencoders are fed with the same input and output data intentionally to createa bottle-neck in the architecture.Autoencoders work well if correlations exist between input date i.e. they perform poorly if all input data is independent.
In this project,we shall feed noisy images from the Fashion MNIST dataset as input and the corresponding noise-free images were provided as targets.The main objective of the autoencoder is to minimise the reconstruction error between the input and the network output.In the end we shall obtain an Autoencoder that is capable of processing a noisy image and generating a clean image from it.
